I was tasked by **MedCorset**, a local manufacturing company, to create an invoicing app.
The requirements were simple but the use-case required crafting a custom app 
from scratch.

## Purpose of the project

The goal was to replace the existing invoicing system which
used paper invoice booklets and manual entry of invoices. The old system had
many issues, including:

- The invoice booklets were not standardized, making it difficult to track
  invoices.
- The invoice total had to be manually calculated, which was prone to human error.

 The developed software was a desktop app built with Flutter with the following
 features:

 - Search for invoices by customer name or date.
 - Products inventory.
 - Product pricing by category.  
 - Export invoices in PDF or PNG format.

## The Process

Since the project was simple, I directly started with the design of the database schema.
I used SQLite database as it's easy to setup in a Flutter project.

The db schema was simple and consisted of the following tables:

- Invoices
- Customers
- Items
