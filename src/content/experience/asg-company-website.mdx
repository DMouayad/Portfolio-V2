Areena Saudi German (ASG) is a leading provider of contracting services in KSA & Germany.

I was tasked with the development of a new portfolio website for the company.
With little to no experience in web development, alhamdulillah, I was able to create a beautiful
and super fast website.

## Purpose of the project

The main purpose was to transform a PDF portfolio into a website where the company can showcase
their portfolio of projects and services.


## The Process

    <div slot="left">
        <p>The goal of Project Phoenix was to modernize a legacy software product and make it more appealing to a new generation of users. Our strategy involved a complete visual overhaul, as well as improvements to the user experience. We worked closely with stakeholders to ensure the new brand identity aligned with the company's vision for the future.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stakeholder workshops</li>
            <li>User surveys and interviews</li>
            <li>A/B testing of new designs</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    </div>

### Storyblok CMS

The website was built to be integrated with Storyblok. This allowed anyone to
 edit the content of the website without any programming knowledge.

#### Live Editor

In addition, Storyblok has the best live editor available in a CMS.
As shown in the video below, you can edit the content of the website
and see the changes in real time.
